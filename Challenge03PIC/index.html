            <h2>Facts about cats</h2>
            <p>The “cat pattern,” established very early in the evolution of modern mammals, was a successful one:
                early cats were already typical in form at a time when the ancestors of most other modern mammalian
                types were scarcely recognizable.</p>
            <p>Cats are an enigma that have captured the hearts of people for thousands of years. Their mysterious
                personalities and adorable looks have made them an incredibly popular pet, and according to a survey
                18% of households in the UK alone are ruled by a cat. With so many cats around us, surely that would
                mean that everyone knows everything possible about them, right? Wrong! There are so many interesting
                facts about cats that you probably haven’t heard of, from the world’s largest cat, to the surprising
                way they walk.</p>
        </div>

        <aside class="sidebar text">
            <h3>Walk</h3>
            <p>Have you ever noticed that cats walk like camels and giraffes? Their walking sequence is both right
                feet first, followed by both left feet, so they move half of their body forward at once. Camels and
                giraffes are the only other animals to walk this way </p>
            <h3> Purr </h3>
            <p>The record for the loudest purr by a domestic cat is currently held by Merlin, a black and white cat
                from Torquay, UK. His purr is 67.8db(A) and for context, this is nearly the same volume as a shower!
                Most cats purr at around 25db.</p>
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p> According to Ancient History Encyclopedia, Herodotus wrote in 440BC that when a pet cat died in
                Ancient Egyptian times the family members would shave off their eyebrows in mourning.</p>
